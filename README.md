1) **Winter 2024-2025 500 MB Geopotential Height Analysis**

   A first time user setup with analyzing NCAR Reanalysis data for 500mb geopotential heights for DJF 2024-2025 (Winter 2024-2025).
   
   In this example we will create 5 graphics showing the following:
   
   i) Mean 500 MB Geopotential Height for the period
   
   ii) EOF1 (1st Principle Component/1st Empirical Orthogonal Function) for the period
   
   iii) EOF2 (2nd Principle Component/2nd Empirical Orthogonal Function) for the period
   
   iv) EOF1 Scores for the period
   
   v) EOF2 Scores for the period

2) **Plotting the Daily Normal Maximum Temperature for July 4th**

   In this example we will plot the daily normal for the maximum temperature for July 4th using the data from PRISM Climate Group.

3) **Plotting the Monthly Normal Maximum Vapor Pressure Deficit for August using the Geographic Area Coordination Center/Predictive Services Areas Reference System**

   In this example we will plot the monthly normal for the Maximum Vapor Pressure Deficit for August using the 'GACC & PSA' reference system.

   This data is from PRISM Climate Group.

4) **Plotting the Daily Precipitation for October 30th, 2012**

   In this example, we will plot the daily precipitation for October 30th, 2012. This was the day Super Storm Sandy hit Long Island and New York City.

   This data is from PRISM Climate Group.
