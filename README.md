# PyClimo-Jupyter-Lab-Examples
A gallery of Jupyter Lab Examples of using PyClimo 

1) A first time user setup with analyzing NCAR Reanalysis data for 500mb geopotential heights for DJF 2024-2025 (Winter 2024-2025).
   
   In this example we will create 5 graphics showing the following:
   
   i) Mean 500 MB Geopotential Height for the period
   
   ii) EOF1 (1st Principle Component/1st Empirical Orthogonal Function) for the period
   
   iii) EOF2 (2nd Principle Component/2nd Empirical Orthogonal Function) for the period
   
   iv) EOF1 Scores for the period
   
   v) EOF2 Scores for the period
